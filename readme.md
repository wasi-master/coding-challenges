# **What is this?**

This a repository for all the code challenges that I do. Keep in mind that all the algorithms for the challenges are thought by me and any resemblance to others is merely coincidental

[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwasi-master%2Fcoding-challenges&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=repo%20views&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)

## Code style

The challenges are done in multiple languages and following all guidelines for all of them is impossible for me, so if you feel like fixing the style then you can open a issue or a pull request

## Contributing

If you feel like something is wrong then you can open a pull request or issue and I'll look into it

## Instructions

<details open>
<summary>These are the instructions on how to run the scripts</summary>

### Python

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   - Download and Install the latest python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Then use `python filename.py` to run the file called filename.py locally (change it to your file name)
2. Online
   - Or run python code online in [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php)
  
- A in-depth guide on how to run python scripts: <https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/>

### Javascript

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Using node.js
    - Download the latest node.js version from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Then use `node filename.js` to run the script called filename.js (change it to your file name)

2. Using your browser

   - To execute JavaScript in a browser you have two options â€” either
     1. Put it inside a script element anywhere inside an HTML document,
     2. Put it inside an external JavaScript file (with a `.js` file extension) and then reference that file inside the HTML document using an empty script element with a src attribute.
3. Online
   - Or run javascript code online in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_javascript_editor.php)
