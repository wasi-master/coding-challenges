# What is this?

This a repository for all the code challenges that I do

## Code style

The challenges are done in multiple languages and following all guidelines for all of them is impossible for me, so if you feel like fixing the style then you can open a issue or a pull request

## Contributing

If you feel like something is wrong then you can open a pull request and I'll look into it

## Instructions

WIP
<!-- TODO: add instructions for all languages -->
