# **What is this?**

This a repository for all the code challenges that I do

## Code style

The challenges are done in multiple languages and following all guidelines for all of them is impossible for me, so if you feel like fixing the style then you can open a issue or a pull request

## Contributing

If you feel like something is wrong then you can open a pull request and I'll look into it

## Languages

Currently has Python, Javascript, C, C++, C#, Rust, Java<br>
Will be added in the future: R, Ruby, Lua

## Instructions

<details open>
<summary>These are the instructions on how to run the scripts</summary>

### Python

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   - Download and Install the latest python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Then use `python filename.py` to run the file called filename.py locally (change it to your file name)
2. Online
   - Or run python code online in [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php)

### Javascript

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Using node.js
    - Download the latest node.js version from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Then use `node filename.js` to run the script called filename.js (change it to your file name)

2. Using your browser

   - To execute JavaScript in a browser you have two options â€” either
     1. Put it inside a script element anywhere inside an HTML document,
     2. Put it inside an external JavaScript file (with a `.js` file extension) and then reference that file inside the HTML document using an empty script element with a src attribute.
3. Online
   - Or run javascript code online in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_javascript_editor.php)

### C

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   - Download the latest version of gcc from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download) or anywhere else
   - Then use `gcc filename.c -o output.exe` to compile the script called filename.c (change it to your file name) and save the output as output.exe (change it to your desired name). and then use `output.exe` to run the script

2. Online
   - Or run c code online in [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)

### C++

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   - Download the latest version of `gcc` from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download) or anywhere else
   - Then use `gcc filename.c -o output.exe` to compile the script called filename.c (change it to your file name) and save the output as output.exe (change it to your desired name). and then use `output.exe` to run the script

2. Online
   - Or run c code online in [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php)

### C\#

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   - Download the latest version of `csc` from [idk where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "Possible link") or anywhere else
   - Then use `csc filename.c -o output.exe` to compile the script called filename.c (change it to your file name) and save the output as output.exe (change it to your desired name). and then use `output.exe` to run the script
2. Online
   - Or run c# code online in [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_csharp_compiler)

### Java

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
    - Download the latest rust version of JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    - Then use `javac run filename.java` to compile and run the script called filename.java (change it to your file name)

2. Online
   - Or run java code online in [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/) or [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler) or [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php)

### Rust

------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Running it locally
   1. Using `cargo`
       - Download the latest rust version from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (rust includes cargo by default)
       - Then use `cargo run filename.rs` to compile and run the script called filename.rs (change it to your file name)

   2. Using `rustc`
       - Download the latest rust version from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
       - Then use `rustc filename.c -o output.exe` to compile the script called filename.c (change it to your file name) and save the output as output.exe (change it to your desired name). and then use `output.exe` to run the script

2. Online
